Work in progress. Some things this directory will include implementations of: 
- CartPole with Deep Q Networks
- Self-Play on tic-tac-toe with policy gradient (single GPU)
- Scaling up self-play on chess, with MCTS and distributed computation
- GRPO on an LLM for reasoning
- RLHF and DPO on an LLM with UltraFeedback-like dataset
- GRPO on an LLM for non-verifiable domain, like humour, via RLAIF with constitution/examples as reward signal
